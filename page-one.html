            <h2>ITERATION 01</h2>
            <p>Moving forward it was determined that light could pierce as far as one bay into the space. A secondary atrium was added to the building so that the inhabitants had access to natural daylight from any location in the interior. The Northwest corner of the building was cut diagonally to create a secondary street entrance that echoed through the building, this started to shape the tenant spaces. </p>

            <h2>ITERATION 02</h2>
            <p>Based on feedback from iteration 01 the shed roof design was scrapped along with the diagonal secondary entrance. The main criticism of these features had to do with the cost required to complete in relation to the added benefit. Additionally, the shed roof created several issues in resolving the new proportions on the building facades. The second iteration added only one floor to the building and resized the atriums to put emphasis on the shared public spaces available to the tenants. </p>

            <h2>ITERATION 03</h2>
            <p>Iteration 03 refined the previous pass of the project. Two sections of the third floor were removed to create South facing rooftop patios for the WeWork tenants. The main atrium was enlarged to span two structural bays so that it was anchored on top of the existing structural grid. The gradient in the section below demonstrates the buildingâ€™s use of stack ventilation to passively cool the building in the summer. Local weather data determined there was not enough wind to support cross ventilation.</p>
